# NYC rats are everywhere. But are restaurants the only ones to be blamed? 

Life in New York City is inseparable from encounters with rats and mice. Many New Yorkers, including reports in The New York Times, have blamed the spread of outdoor dining during the pandemic. But my view is that restaurants are not the only factor attracting these rodents. When I mapped the locations of rodent sightings, the pattern appeared widespread — and somewhat ominous — across the city. Although the true causes of New York’s rodent problem still need to be investigated, it is clear that the city must address the issue comprehensively.

By the way, before I came to New York, I actually had a somewhat positive feeling toward rats and mice — after all, I was born in the Year of the Rat. But living here has definitely turned that sentiment upside down🐭
